    <h1>Sundial</h1>
<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
<p>
<b>A sundial measures time by the position of the sun.</b> The most commonly seen designs, such as <br> the 'ordinary' or standard garden sundial, cast a shadow on a flat surface marked with the hours of <br> the day. As the position of the sun changes, the time indicated by the shadow changes. However, <br> sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow.</p>
<p>Most sundial designs indicate apparent solar time. Minor design variations can measure standard <br> and daylight saving time, as well.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>
Sundials in the form of obelisks (3500 BC) and shadow clocks (1500 BC) are <b> known from ancient <br> Egypt,</b> and were developed further by other cultures, including the Chinese, Greek, and Roman <br>cultures. A type of sundial without gnomon is described in the old Old Testament (Isaiah 38:2).</p>
<p>
The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia (ca. 160 BC-ca. 100 BC) is said to have <br /> invented a universal sundial that could be used anywhere on Earth. The French astronomer Oronce <br> Fine constructed a sundial of ivory in 1524. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a <br>treatise on the sundial in 1570, in which he included instructions for the manufacture and laying out <br> of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Gluseppe Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia <br> solaria discusses how to make a perfect sundial, with accompanying illustrations.</p>

Installation of standard sundials</h2>
Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. By tilting such a sundial, it <br> may be installed so that it will keep time. However some mass-produced garden sundials are
